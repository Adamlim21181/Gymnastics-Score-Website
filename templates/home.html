      Welcome to my Gymnast's competition score calculator. You can add gymnasts and scores to create a leaderboard for your competition. Here are some instructions to help you get started.

    <p>
      To add your gymnasts to the competition, go to the <a href="/addgymnast">gymnast page</a> enter your gymnast's name and level in the first form, and click submit. Your gymnast should be added to the table underneath the form!

    <h3>Step 2 - Adding Scores</h3>

    <h3>Step 4 - Editing and Deleting</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, you can edit and delete your gymnasts and scores!

Just fill out these forms, and you should see the changes in the same table above!
